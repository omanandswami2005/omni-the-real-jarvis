## What is Omni?

**Omni** is a multi-client AI agent hub that lets you speak to one intelligent agent from any device — web dashboard, mobile, Chrome extension, desktop, or smart glasses — and have it act across all of them simultaneously.

Built for the [Gemini Live Agent Challenge](https://googleai.devpost.com/) hackathon, Omni demonstrates how a single AI brain powered by **Google Gemini Live API** and **Google ADK** can orchestrate actions across every device you own.
